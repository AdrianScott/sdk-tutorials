# App

We will be putting the app together now. To make it easier there is an app starter located located in the helpers folder in the root of the module.

We will need to add the module we created. For this application we will be using a couple modules:

1. Auth - this gives us an account based module for the blockchain
2. Supply - this tracks the total supply of tokens on the blockchain
3. Bank - enables transfers between accounts
4. Staking - creates delegated proof of stake for the chain
5. Distribution - handle distribution of tokens for fees and block rewards
6. Params - parameters of the application, they can also be changed through governance, which we are not using in this tutorial
7. NFT - bring non-fungible tokens to your application
