# NFT Auction

This tutorial is meant to show developers more a intricate usage of features of the [Cosmos-SDK](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk)

This tutorial does not cover the lower level of the Cosmos-SDK and Tendermint (the consensus and networking), if you would like to dive deeper into how the Cosmos-SDK works or how [Tendermint](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint) works you can go to the [cosmos-SDK docs](https://cosmos.network/docs/) or the [Tendermint docs](https://tendermint.com/docs/)

## Tutorial

In this Tutorial we will be creating a auction market for non-fungible tokens. If you are new to NFT's then I do recommend reading this [NFT guide](https://coincentral.com/nfts-non-fungible-tokens/).
